## üìã Overview

This repository serves as a shared resource for the ethPandaOps team to store and maintain:
- Claude Code commands and workflows
- Shared scripts and utilities
- Team conventions and best practices

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethpandaops/ai-cookbook.git
   cd ai-cookbook
   ```

2. Run the installer to set up all tools:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Install recommended tools (fastest option):
   ```bash
   ai-cookbook recommended
   ```
   This installs the team's recommended configuration automatically.

4. Or launch the interactive installer for custom selection:
   ```bash
   ai-cookbook
   ```
   Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select components, and 'q' to quit.

5. To update everything, simply run:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ai-cookbook recommended
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### Getting Started
After installation, Claude Code commands are immediately available. Start any Claude Code session and reference commands by name.

### ‚ö° Recommended Tools Command
The fastest way to get up and running with the team's standard configuration:

```bash
# Install all recommended tools automatically
ai-cookbook recommended

# Skip confirmation prompts for automation
ai-cookbook recommended --yes

# Install individual tools with the interactive installer
ai-cookbook
```

This command:
- ‚úÖ Installs all team-recommended tools (commands, code standards, hooks, scripts)
- üîí Only removes Claude tools it knows are ethPandaOps-managed for safety

The recommended configuration is defined in `recommended-tools.yaml` and maintained by the team.

### üìö Initialize AI Documentation in Any Repository

**WARNING**: With the release of Claude 4 you probably don't need this script. Claude is smart enough to understand the project structure and conventions without it.

Use the `init-ai-docs.py` script to set up comprehensive AI documentation in any project:

```bash
# Initialize docs in current directory
init-ai-docs.py

# Initialize docs in specific project
init-ai-docs.py /path/to/project

# Preview what will be created
init-ai-docs.py --dry-run
```

This creates:
- Project-level CLAUDE.md and .cursor/rules/
- Component-level CLAUDE.md files
- Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI tools

See [full documentation](docs/init-ai-docs.md) for detailed usage and options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Claude Code Commands

The following commands are available after installation:

### `init-project-ai-docs`

Initializes top-level AI documentation for the entire project with foundational structure and project-wide rules. Use this when setting up AI documentation for a new project to establish consistent coding standards and development workflows.

### `prime-context`

Reads and loads project context files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs) into Claude's working memory. Use this at the start of a Claude session to ensure Claude understands your project structure and conventions.

### `init-component-ai-docs`

Initializes AI documentation for a specific component/directory within a project with component-specific rules. Use this when adding AI documentation to individual components or modules within an existing project structure.

### `parallel-repository-tasks`

Executes the same action across multiple repositories in parallel for batch operations. Use this when you need to analyze patterns, implement changes, or audit multiple repositories simultaneously.

### `create-implementation-plan`

Creates a detailed implementation plan with scaffolding for features or system enhancements (deprecated - use v2). Use this when you need a structured approach to implementing complex features with clear milestones.

### `create-implementation-plan-v2`

Generates comprehensive implementation plans optimized for maximum parallelization during execution. Use this for planning complex features where you want Claude to identify and execute independent tasks concurrently.

### `create-implementation-plan-v3`

Enhanced implementation planning with improved analysis, dependency management, and execution tracking. Use this for the most sophisticated planning needs with automated progress monitoring.

### `review-implementation-plan`

Facilitates systematic review of implementation plans with step-by-step analysis and feedback collection. Use this to review and refine implementation plans before execution, ensuring all proposed changes align with project requirements. Usually run after `create-implementation-plan-v2` has generated the plan.

### `eip`

Analyzes Ethereum Improvement Proposals by fetching content and optionally deep-diving into implementations. Use this when you need to understand an EIP's specifications and see how various clients have implemented it.

### `create-feedback-loop`

Creates a temporary feedback loop script that iterates with Claude until a success condition is met. Use this when you need Claude to repeatedly attempt a task (like fixing tests or meeting performance targets) until it succeeds.

### `create-presentation`

Creates succinct and effective presentations in Marp format with automatic HTML generation. Use this when you need to generate professional presentations from complex topics with clear, space-efficient slides.

### `prepare-one-shot`

Enables one-shot implementation mode for automated end-to-end feature development with issue creation, parallel implementation, and PR creation. Use this when you want Claude to autonomously implement a complete feature from planning through CI monitoring without manual intervention.
