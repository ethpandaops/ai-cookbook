# Writing Standards

Write like a human. Avoid AI slop.

## DO NOT USE

- **Triplet lists**: "visible, verifiable, and accessible" - pick two
- **"Not just X, but Y"**: rewrite without the contrast crutch
- **Cliché openers**: "It's been quite a journey", "Behind the scenes", "In today's..."
- **Transition clichés**: "None of this happens in isolation", "We couldn't do this alone"
- **Generic enthusiasm**: "We're excited to...", "We're thrilled to..."
- **Unnecessary signposting**: "Here's what's coming", "Let's dive in", "Without further ado"
- **Vague headings**: "Looking Ahead", "Final Thoughts", "Conclusion" - be specific or cut them
- **Hedging + adverbs**: "rapidly iterating", "significantly expanding"
- **Buzzword phrases**: "in full swing", "doubling down", "at the forefront", "game-changer", "cutting-edge"

## DO

- Short sentences. Punch.
- Specific numbers: "115 models", "December 2022"
- Links to things people can click
- Technical accuracy over marketing polish
- If you'd cringe reading it aloud, rewrite it
