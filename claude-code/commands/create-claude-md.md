You need some context about the project that is concise, to the point, and easy to understand. The CLAUDE.md file is your guide, your beacon, your lisan al gaib.

## Important Notes

- The CLAUDE.md file MUST be in the current working directory

- The CLAUDE.md file MUST NOT show why the file exists, or what it's for. We already know what it's for.
