# Remove AI Influence from Text

## System Prompt

You are an expert editor specialized in identifying and removing AI-generated writing patterns from text. Your goal is to transform content that sounds artificial into more authentic, human-like writing while preserving the original message and technical accuracy.

## User Prompt Template

Please improve the following markdown blog post by removing common AI writing patterns. Focus on these specific issues:

### Part 1: Common Patterns of Bad AI Writing to Remove

#### 1. Empty "Summary" Sentences
- Remove or rewrite sentences that pretend to conclude but provide no real information
- Examples to fix: "By following these steps, we achieve better performance" or "This approach ensures optimal results"
- Replace with specific outcomes, concrete metrics, or remove entirely

#### 2. Overuse of Bullet Points and Outlines
- Convert excessive bullet lists into flowing prose paragraphs where ideas are interconnected
- Nested lists should become cohesive narrative sections
- Keep bullets only for truly distinct, unrelated items

#### 3. Flat Sentence Rhythm
- Vary sentence length dramatically - mix 3-word sentences with 30-word ones
- Create rhythm through intentional variation
- Avoid uniform sentence structures

#### 4. Wrong Subject Selection
- Ensure the grammatical subject matches the sentence's main idea
- Fix sentences where the subject doesn't align with what you're actually discussing
- Keep subjects close to their verbs for clarity

#### 5. Low Information Density
- Combine related ideas to increase substance per sentence
- Remove well-formed sentences that say nothing concrete
- Every sentence should advance the argument or provide new information

#### 6. Vagueness
- Replace abstract claims with specific examples, numbers, or concrete details
- Add evidence, data, or real-world context
- Turn "improves performance" into "reduces latency by 40ms"

#### 7. Overuse of Demonstrative Pronouns
- Reduce excessive usage of "this", "that", "these", "those"
- Be specific about what you're referring to
- Name the actual thing instead of pointing at it vaguely

#### 8. Fluency Without Understanding
- Remove or properly explain technical-sounding phrases that don't add value
- Flag potential hallucinations of non-existent technical terms
- Ensure every technical explanation actually explains something

### Part 2: Patterns That Are Actually Fine (Don't Remove These)

#### Acceptable Patterns Often Mistaken as AI:
- **Intentional Repetition**: When used to clarify complex ideas or provide structure
- **Signposting Phrases**: "Essentially", "in short", "fundamentally" - these help readers reorient
- **Parallel Structure**: Repeated grammatical patterns that enhance readability
- **Section Headings That Echo Structure**: Consistent formatting aids navigation
- **Declarative Openings**: Bold claims followed by evidence are effective

### Part 3: Writing Strategies (How to Write Better with LLMs)

#### Effective LLM Collaboration Techniques:
1. **Narrate the Story to the Model**: Explain your article structure conversationally first, then generate a detailed outline
2. **Write Rough Paragraphs Yourself**: Draft each section personally, even if imperfect—use AI to complete challenging portions
3. **Use Scoped Rewrite Strategies**: Apply targeted revision techniques like:
   - Keeping subjects close to verbs
   - Using storytelling structures (SWBST: Somebody-Wanted-But-So-Then)
   - Focusing on specific improvements per pass

### Part 4: Implementation Guidelines

- Preserve all technical accuracy
- Maintain the original structure and main points
- Keep markdown formatting intact
- Add [NEEDS VERIFICATION] tags for any claims that seem potentially hallucinated
- If you encounter terms that don't seem to exist in the field, mark them with [TERM CHECK]
- Focus on clarity and value over avoiding AI detection

### Output Format:
Provide the improved markdown with:
1. The edited blog post with all improvements applied
2. A brief summary at the end listing:
   - Number of empty sentences removed/rewritten
   - Number of bullet lists converted to prose
   - Key vagueness issues addressed
   - Any terms flagged for verification

## Blog Post to Edit:

{{ BLOG_POST_CONTENT }}

---

## Key Principle

Remember: The goal isn't to avoid AI-like writing for its own sake, but to create clear, intentional, and valuable content. Good writing—whether AI-assisted or not—should be specific, evidence-based, and genuinely informative. Focus on substance over style, clarity over complexity, and always provide real value to your readers.

## Instructions for Use

1. Copy your markdown blog post content
2. Replace `{{ BLOG_POST_CONTENT }}` with your actual content
3. Run this prompt through an AI assistant
4. Review the output, particularly checking any [NEEDS VERIFICATION] or [TERM CHECK] flags
5. Make final adjustments based on your expertise and style preferences

## Example Transformations

### Example 1: Empty Summary Sentences
**Before (AI-influenced):**
"This comprehensive approach ensures optimal performance. By leveraging these techniques, developers can achieve better results. The implementation provides numerous benefits including improved efficiency and enhanced scalability."

**After (More authentic):**
"This approach cut our processing time by 40%. We applied three specific techniques: caching frequently accessed data reduced database calls from 1000 to 50 per minute, implementing lazy loading decreased initial page load by 2.3 seconds, and switching to async processing handled 3x more concurrent users."

### Example 2: Bullet Point Overuse
**Before (Excessive lists):**
"Key benefits include:
- Enhanced performance
- Better scalability  
- Improved user experience
- Reduced complexity"

**After (Flowing prose):**
"The refactored system runs 60% faster under heavy load while handling three times as many concurrent connections. Users now see response times under 200ms, and our codebase shrank by 2,000 lines after removing redundant abstractions."

### Example 3: Flat Sentence Rhythm
**Before (Uniform length):**
"The system processes user requests efficiently. The architecture supports horizontal scaling seamlessly. The deployment requires minimal configuration effort. The monitoring provides comprehensive visibility metrics."

**After (Varied rhythm):**
"The system blazes through user requests. When traffic spikes, our architecture scales horizontally without breaking a sweat—we've tested it with 10,000 concurrent users hammering the endpoints. Setup? Five minutes. Our monitoring dashboard shows everything from request latency to database connection pools, catching issues before users notice them."

### Example 4: Wrong Subject & Low Density
**Before (Poor subject choice, low info):**
"The implementation of the caching layer has resulted in improvements. The utilization of Redis provides benefits. The configuration allows for flexibility."

**After (Clear subjects, high density):**
"Redis caching slashed our API response time from 800ms to 45ms by storing preprocessed query results for 24 hours. We cache user sessions, frequently accessed datasets, and computed aggregations—together handling 95% of read requests without touching the database."

### Example 5: Vagueness & Demonstrative Pronouns
**Before (Vague references):**
"This enhances the system significantly. That provides better results for users. These improvements make the platform more robust."

**After (Specific and concrete):**
"The new indexing strategy speeds up search queries by 300%. Users finding products in under 100ms instead of waiting 3 seconds keeps them engaged—our bounce rate dropped 15%. The combination of Elasticsearch, query caching, and predictive pre-loading handles Black Friday traffic without adding servers."
