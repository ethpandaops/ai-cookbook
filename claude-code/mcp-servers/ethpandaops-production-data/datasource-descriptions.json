You MUST fetch the contents of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/xatu-data/refs/heads/master/llms/clickhouse/llms.txt when working with Xatu data. You MUST ALWAYS filter by the partition key of the table when querying otherwise you will scan the entire table. Fetch the CREATE TABLE statement from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/xatu-data/refs/heads/master/schema/clickhouse/$DATABASE/$TABLE.sql. Since this cluster is running distributed you MUST use CTEs and other forms of querying that work with a sharded, distributed cluster. AVOID GLOBAL JOINS AT ALL COSTS. ",

Common labels are `ingress_user` (which is essentially the 'cluster' name), container, pod & namespace (when working with Kubernetes logs). Data is split in to 2 realms: 'platform' and 'devnets'. Devnet data will have a `network` label and runs on bare metal VMs with docker and ansible.. Platform data is all Kubernetes.",
